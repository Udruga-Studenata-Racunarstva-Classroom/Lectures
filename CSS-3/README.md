## SASS
> A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.

> Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.
